# Role-Based Authentication Implementation

## Overview
We have successfully implemented role-based authentication with three user categories as specified in the main README.md requirements.

## User Categories Implemented

### 1. Individual Users
- **Purpose**: Personal health management and consultation
- **Access**: Basic dashboard with personal health features

### 2. Healthcare Professionals
- **Purpose**: Enhanced diagnostic tools and patient management
- **Required Fields**: License Number (required), Specialization (optional)
- **Access**: Professional dashboard with enhanced features

### 3. Medical Facilities
- **Purpose**: Institutional access with multi-user management
- **Required Fields**: Facility Name (required)
- **Access**: Facility management dashboard

## Authentication Flow

### New User Registration (Email/Password)
1. User goes to `/auth/signup`
2. Fills out registration form (email, password, display name)
3. After successful registration → redirected to `/role-selection`
4. Selects role and fills role-specific information
5. Completes setup → redirected to `/dashboard`

### New User Registration (Google OAuth)
1. User goes to `/auth/signin` and clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google authentication completes
3. System detects incomplete authentication → redirected to `/role-selection`
4. Selects role and fills role-specific information
5. Completes setup → redirected to `/dashboard`

### Existing User Login
1. User goes to `/auth/signin`
2. Signs in with email/password or Google
3. If authentication is complete → redirected to `/dashboard`
4. If authentication incomplete → redirected to `/role-selection`

### Error Handling for Non-Existent Users
- When user tries to sign in with email/password but account doesn't exist
- Clear error message: "No account found with this email. Please sign up first or check your email address."
- Link to sign up page provided

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:
- `web/types/user.ts` - User role types and interfaces
- `web/services/userService.ts` - Firestore user profile management
- `web/components/RoleSelection.tsx` - Role selection component
- `web/app/role-selection/page.tsx` - Role selection page

#### Modified Files:
- `web/config/firebase.ts` - Added Firestore
- `web/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced with role management
- `web/components/AuthGuard.tsx` - Role-aware route protection
- `web/app/page.tsx` - Role-aware redirects
- `web/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Role-specific information display
- `web/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Better error handling

### Data Structure

#### UserProfile (Firestore)
```typescript
{
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  displayName?: string;
  role?: 'individual' | 'healthcare_professional' | 'medical_facility';
  authenticationComplete: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  // Role-specific fields
  facilityName?: string; // For medical facilities
  licenseNumber?: string; // For healthcare professionals
  specialization?: string; // For healthcare professionals
}
```

### Route Protection Logic

1. **Public Routes** (`/`, `/auth/*`): Accessible to non-authenticated users
2. **Role Selection** (`/role-selection`): Only for authenticated users with incomplete setup
3. **Protected Routes** (`/dashboard`): Only for fully authenticated users with complete setup

### Key Features

✅ **Role Selection Required**: All users must select a role before accessing the dashboard
✅ **Google OAuth Handling**: Catches Google sign-ins and requires role selection
✅ **Firestore Integration**: User profiles stored securely in Firestore
✅ **Role-Specific Fields**: Different required fields based on selected role
✅ **Error Handling**: Clear messages for non-existent users
✅ **Route Protection**: Smart redirects based on authentication state
✅ **Role Display**: Dashboard shows role-specific information

## Testing the Implementation

### Test Cases to Verify:

1. **New Email/Password Registration**
   - Sign up → Role selection → Dashboard

2. **New Google OAuth Registration**
   - Google sign in → Role selection → Dashboard

3. **Existing User Login**
   - Sign in → Dashboard (if setup complete)

4. **Non-existent User Login**
   - Try to sign in → Error message → Link to sign up

5. **Role-Specific Information**
   - Healthcare Professional: License number required
   - Medical Facility: Facility name required
   - Individual: No additional fields

6. **Route Protection**
   - Try accessing `/dashboard` without auth → Redirect to sign in
   - Try accessing `/dashboard` with incomplete setup → Redirect to role selection

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for role-based access control. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Role-Specific Dashboards**: Different UI/features based on user role
2. **Permission System**: Granular permissions within each role
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: SMS/Phone verification
4. **HIPAA Compliance**: Enhanced security measures
5. **Facility User Management**: Allow medical facilities to manage multiple users
